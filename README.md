# Algorithm-problems

## How to:
  
  ### Problem 1:
  You need to create an structure to change all values of an structure and can save other values that are different from others. The solution to this problem should have the less cost you could archieve. You have to implement the three methods decribed bellow.
  
      setAll(key: String, value: Int) 
        """ When calling this method should set the same value for all the keys on your structure. """
        
      set(key: String, value: Int)
          """ When calling this method should set the value for one of the keys on your structure. """
          
      get(key: String): Int
        """ When calling this method should get the value stored on the key of your structure. """
